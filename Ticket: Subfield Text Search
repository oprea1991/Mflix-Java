Chapter 1: Driver Setup

Ticket: Subfield Text Search
Problem:

User Story

"As a user, I'd like to be able to search movies by cast members, genre, or perform a text search of the plot summary, full plot, and title."

Task

For this ticket, you will need to modify the method getMoviesByCast in MovieDao.java to allow the following movie search criteria:

cast: finds all movies that match the cast members of a movie
Already, MovieDao.java has implementation methods that is able to return results for two different types of movie search criteria:

text : getMoviesByText - performs a text search in the movies collection
genres: getMoviesByGenre - finds movies that include any of the wanted genres.
You just need to construct the query that retrieves the movies collection by cast.

A text index was created for you when you restored the collections with mongorestore, so these queries will be efficient once they are implemented.

Hint

Check the implementation of similar formats of search criteria - the cast query should similar.
MFlix Functionality

Once you complete this ticket, the UI will allow movie searches by criteria of the cast, movie genres, movie title, and plot summary.

Testing and Running the Application

Make sure to look at the tests in TextAndSubfieldTest.java to understand what is expected.

If the application is already running, stop the application and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:

mvn test -Dtest=TextAndSubfieldTest
Once the unit tests are passing, run the application with:

mvn spring-boot:run
Or run the Application.java from your IDE.

Now proceed to the status page to run the full suite of integration tests and get your validation code.

To have the application use the changes that you implemented for this ticket, make sure to restart the application after you completed those changes. Also, only refresh the status page to see the new results of the tests, after the application has been restarted.

After passing the relevant tests, what is the validation code for Text and Subfield Search?

  public List<Document> getMoviesCastFaceted(int limit, int skip, String... cast) {
    List<Document> movies = new ArrayList<>();
    String sortKey = "tomatoes.viewer.numReviews";
    Bson skipStage = Aggregates.skip(skip);
    Bson matchStage = Aggregates.match(Filters.in("cast", cast));
    Bson sortStage = Aggregates.sort(Sorts.descending(sortKey));
    Bson limitStage = Aggregates.limit(limit);
    Bson facetStage = buildFacetStage();
    // Using a LinkedList to ensure insertion order
    List<Bson> pipeline = new LinkedList<>();

    // TODO > Ticket: Faceted Search - build the aggregation pipeline by adding all stages in the

    // correct order
    // Your job is to order the stages correctly in the pipeline.
    // Starting with the `matchStage` add the remaining stages.
    pipeline.add(matchStage);
    pipeline.add(sortStage);
    pipeline.add(skipStage);
    pipeline.add(limitStage);
    pipeline.add(facetStage);
    moviesCollection.aggregate(pipeline).iterator().forEachRemaining(movies::add);
    return movies;
  }
